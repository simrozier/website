## Research

My work focuses on theoretical aspects related to the way stellar systems react to external perturbations.

### Stability of rotating spherical models

During my PhD with Christophe Pichon and Jean-Baptiste Fouvry, I developed and implemented an analytical method to detect linear instabilities in spherical stellar systems: I adapted Kalnajs' matrix method ([Kalnajs 1976](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1977ApJ...212..637K/abstract)) to the case of anisotropic, rotating globular clusters. Thanks to this new algorithm, I was able to analyse the stability of more than 1000 models of globular clusters, with varying degree of velocity anisotropy (radial and tangential), as well as different amounts of global angular momentum. These results were confirmed by a positive comparison with dedicated _N_-body simulations ([Rozier _et al._, 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.487..711R/abstract"></a>)), see the figure below). While this study highlighted a regime of radial orbit instability, enhanced by the system's rotation, we discovered another regime of dramatic instabilities in tangentially anisotropic, rotating systems. My subsequent work was largely focused on answering the tricky question of identifying specific processes responsible for these instabilities.

    <figcaption class="research-image-caption">Growth rate of linear instabilities in spherical stellar clusters as a function of anisotropy (q) and rotation (α). The blue plane represents a region where no instabilities were detected. The elongated dark surface on the bottom right is the region of rotationally enhanced radial orbit instability. There, the cluster is radially biased (q&gt;0), and the instability is enhanced by rotation (increasing α). The large orange surface on the top corresponds to the region of violent instability in tangentially anisotropic (q&lt;0), fast rotators (α&gt;0.5). This surface is a discovery of our work.

We followed up this work, using both the matrix method and _N_-body simulations to identify specific processes responsible for the instabilities of tangentially anisotropic, rotating spheres ([Breen _et al._, 2021](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.502.4762B/abstract)). We showed that (i) the destabilisation process in these systems is much more intricate than the radial orbit instability, (ii) it involves interactions between particles at different locations in the cluster – mainly high-inclination orbits close to the centre with low-inclination ones further away –, and (iii) it involves several resonant processes – mainly the inner Lindblad resonance leading to the circular orbit instability, and the tumbling resonance leading to the tumbling instability.

### Response of the Milky Way halo to the sinking Large Magellanic Cloud

Later, I developed a new matrix method to compute the time evolution a stellar system when perturbed by an external gravitational potential. I applied it to compute how the infall of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) perturbs the Milky Way dark matter and stellar halos ([Rozier _et al._, 2022](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv220105589R/abstract)). The method successfully reproduced the results from state-of-the-art _N_-body simulations by [Garavito-Camargo _et al._, 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...884...51G/abstract) (see figure below). The critical interest of the matrix method is its extreme numerical efficiency compared to that of numerical simulations. Therefore, I could test the computation starting from different initial velocity distributions of the Milky Way stellar halo. These experiments showed that the stellar halo's response to the LMC can be used to constrain the halo's initial velocity anisotropy.

### Collisionless relaxation of tidally stripped dark matter subhalos

In [Rozier & Errani (2024)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024arXiv240203430R/abstract), I complemented linear theory with two new methods: an efficient way to compute the steady state reached by a stellar model initially placed slightly out of equilibrium, and a way to compute moments of the velocity distribution of a stellar system along its collisionless relaxation. I applied these new methods to dark matter subhalo models undergoing tidal stripping, which showed that (i) the central cusp of a dark matter suhalo does not completely protect it from the effect of the tide, and (ii) collisionless relaxation can result in a tangentially anisotropic equilibrium, even when the initial velocity distribution is isotropic.
